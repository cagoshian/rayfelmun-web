  It is a great honor to welcome you to this distinguished conference. This event holds significant meaning not only for me, but also for my dedicated team and the city of Lüleburgaz. This Model United Nations conference marks the very first of its kind to be held in Lüleburgaz, and I am proud to state that we have devoted considerable effort to ensure that you, our honorable delegates, have a memorable and exceptional first experience.

  Over the course of these two days, you, our esteemed delegates, will at times seek solutions to various issues, at times engage in debates, at times defend your positions, and at times simply enjoy yourselves to the fullest.

  Our teams have worked tirelessly for weeks, pushing their limits and striving to bring out the very best in themselves. They have done an outstanding job in preparing for this conference, and I have no doubt that they will present their accomplishments to you flawlessly. As the Deputy Secretary-General of this conference, I take great pride in all of my teams and extend my heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of them.

  We eagerly await to witness you in debates, in defenses, occasionally in deadlocks, and at times reaching meaningful agreements within our school. I wish you all a memorable and outstanding conference experience.
